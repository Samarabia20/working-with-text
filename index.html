  <strong>Cardinal (Carduelis cucullata)</strong>
  <p>
    <i><b>It is a small bird measuring about 10 cm and exhibits sexual dimorphism, since males are more colorful than females.</b> It had a reduced presence in nearby regions, but it is in Venezuela where the largest population distribution of the species has existed. This distribution was distributed mainly to northern states, with an altitude between 400 and 1,400 meters, in various types of forests and arid areas.</i>
